The powerup Json is structured in the following way:
{   
    # Overall powerups key
    "powerups": [

        # Each powerup has a section like this
        {
            # The name of the powerup, used by the game internally
            "name": "paddleSpeed",

            # How long should it last for in whole seconds
            "duration": 8
        }
    ]
}
